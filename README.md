  - **VS Code**: 1.99.0 or later

## Setup

### Install the extension

From the VS Code Marketplace or GitHub install the latest version of the extension.


## Usage

### Authentication

The extension supports two authentication methods for connecting to Keeper Security:

#### 1. Base64 Configuration Authentication

This method uses a base64-encoded configuration string that contains your Keeper Security credentials.

**Steps:**
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type `Keeper Security: Authenticate` and select it
3. Choose "base64" from the authentication method dropdown
4. Enter your base64 configuration string

#### 2. Token Authentication

This method uses a one-time token for authentication.

**Steps:**
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type `Keeper Security: Authenticate` and select it
3. Choose "token" from the authentication method dropdown
4. Enter your one-time token

### Available Commands

Once authenticated, you can access the following commands through the Command Palette:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Save in Keeper Security** | Save selected text as secret in vault saveValueToVault` |
| **Get from Keeper Security** | Insert existing secrets from vault getValueFromVault` |
| **Generate Password** | Generate and store secure passwords |
| **Run Securely** | Execute commands with injected secrets |

### Command Details

#### Save Secrets in Keeper Vault

1. **Using Command Palette**

    **Purpose**: Save selected text as a secret in Keeper Security vault and replace it with a reference.

    **Steps**:
    1. Select text containing a secret (password, token, API key)
    2. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
    3. Type `Keeper Security: Save in Keeper Vault` and select it
    4. Extension will authenticate with Keeper Security (if needed)
    5. Extension creates new item in Keeper vault
    6. Selected text is replaced with secret reference (`keeper://...`)
    7. User receives confirmation of successful save

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    // Before: Selected text
    const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef";

    // After: Replaced with reference
    const apiKey = "keeper://vault/api-keys/openai";
    ```

2. Detect Secrets Automatically

    **Purpose**: Automatically detect potential secrets in your code for easy identification and securing.

    **Features**:
    - Extension scans files for known secret patterns
    - Provides CodeLens for detected secrets
    - CodeLens shows `Save in Keeper Security` option
    - Different detection rules for `.env` files vs regular code files
    - Click CodeLens to save detected secret

    **Example Detection Patterns**:
    - API keys: `sk-`, `pk_`, `Bearer `, etc.
    - Passwords: `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`
    - Tokens: `token`, `secret`, `key`
    - Environment variables: `API_KEY`, `SECRET_`, `PASSWORD`

#### Retrieve Secrets from Keeper Vault

**Purpose**: Insert existing Keeper Security secrets into your code without exposing actual values.

**Steps**:
1. Open Command Palette
2. Type `Keeper Security: Get from Keeper Vault` and select it
3. Extension shows list of available Keeper items
4. Select specific item and field
5. Extension inserts secret reference at cursor position

**Reference Format**: `keeper://vault/item/field`

**Example**:
```javascript
// Cursor position before command
const databasePassword = |

// After selecting from vault
const databasePassword = keeper://vault/database/production/password
```

#### Generate New Random Password

**Purpose**: Generate secure passwords and store them in Keeper Security without leaving VS Code.

**Steps**:
1. Open Command Palette
2. Type `Keeper Security: Generate Password` and select it
3. Provide name for new item (e.g., "Database Password", "API Key")
4. Extension creates item in Keeper vault
5. Extension inserts secret reference at cursor position

**Generated Password Features**:
- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Configurable length and complexity
- Automatic storage in Keeper vault
- Reference format: `keeper://vault/generated/[item-name]`

#### Run Commands Securely

**Purpose**: Run commands with secrets injected from Keeper Security for secure application execution.

**Steps**:
1. Open Command Palette
2. Type `Keeper Security: Run Securely` and select it
3. Extension reads `.env` file with `keeper://` references
4. Extension resolves secrets from Keeper vault
5. Extension creates isolated terminal with injected secrets
6. User can run any command with secrets available as environment variables

**Example `.env` file**:
```env
DATABASE_URL=keeper://vault/database/production/url
API_KEY=keeper://vault/api/keys/openai
SECRET_TOKEN=keeper://vault/tokens/jwt
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Secrets are automatically available as environment variables
npm start
# DATABASE_URL, API_KEY, SECRET_TOKEN are injected
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Failures

**Problem**: "Authentication failed" errors when trying to connect to Keeper Security

**Solutions**:
- Verify your base64 configuration string is complete and properly formatted
- Ensure your one-time token hasn't expired (tokens expire after use)
- Check your internet connection and firewall settings
- Verify your Keeper Security account has Secrets Manager access enabled

#### 2. Commands Not Available

**Problem**: Keeper Security commands don't appear in Command Palette

**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're authenticated first by running "Keeper Security: Authenticate"
- Reload VS Code window if commands still don't appear
- Check the extension is properly installed and activated

#### 3. Extension Not Loading

**Problem**: Extension fails to activate or shows errors

**Solutions**:
- Check VS Code version compatibility (requires 1.99.0 or later)
- Verify Node.js version (requires 18.0.0 or later)
- Check the Output panel for detailed error messages
- Try reinstalling the extension

#### 5. Secret Detection Not Working

**Problem**: CodeLens doesn't appear for potential secrets

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the file is saved and recognized by VS Code
- Check that the secret patterns match the detection rules
- Reload the extension if detection stops working
- Verify the file type is supported (.js, .ts, .env, etc.)

#### 6. Secret References Not Resolving

**Problem**: `keeper://` references don't resolve to actual values

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're authenticated with Keeper Security
- Verify the reference format is correct
- Check that the referenced item exists in your vault
- Ensure the field name matches exactly

#### 7. Run Securely Command Issues

**Problem**: Commands don't have access to injected secrets

**Solutions**:
- Verify your `.env` file contains valid `keeper://` references
- Ensure all referenced secrets exist in your vault
- Check that the terminal is created by the extension
- Verify the extension has permission to create terminals

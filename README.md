## Overview

A comprehensive VS Code extension that integrates Keeper Security vault functionality directly into the development workflow. The extension provides secure secret management capabilities including saving, retrieving, generating, and running commands with secrets from Keeper Security vault.

  - **Configuration Files**: .env, JSON, YAML files
  - **Pattern Recognition**: API keys, passwords, tokens, JWT, AWS keys, Stripe keys, and more
- **Secure Execution**: Run commands with secrets injected from Keeper vault
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging system with debug mode support

## Prerequisites

- **Keeper Commander CLI**: Must be installed and authenticated on your system
  - Download from [Keeper Commander Installation Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/commander-installation-setup)

- Ensure CLI is accessible from your system PATH
- Verify installation with `keeper --version` in terminal

#### 3. Authentication Failures

**Problem**: "Keeper Commander CLI is not authenticated" errors

**Solutions**:
- Open terminal and run `keeper login`
- Enter your Keeper Security credentials
- Ensure authentication is successful before using extension
- Remember that authentication is session-based

#### 4. Commands Not Available

**Problem**: Keeper Security commands don't appear in Command Palette

**Solution**: 
- Ensure Keeper Commander CLI is installed and authenticated
- Reload VS Code window if commands still don't appear
